Coding Challenge: Build a responsive webpage.

Imagine you are building a weather application. Your task is to create a responsive webpage that displays the current weather information. The page should have the following features:

Weather Information:

Display the current temperature, weather condition, and location.
Background Image:

Change the background image of the component based on the weather condition. For example, use a sunny background for clear weather, a rainy background for rainy weather, etc.
Styling:

Implement a clean and visually appealing design using HTML and CSS.Ensure that the component looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
API Integration(Not necessary, but would be great if you can):

Fetch weather data from a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). Use states to display errors, loading, etc if you are using any frame works.
